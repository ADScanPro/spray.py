# Project Structure (Adapted for single-script project)

- For this single-script project, `spray.py` in the root is acceptable.
- If the project grows, consider moving to `src/spray/` structure.
- Tests should go under `tests/` if added.
- Documentation in `README.md` is sufficient for this project size.
- Configuration files (`.env.example`, `pyproject.toml`) stay in root.

- When sharing code in responses, include short context snippets plus an explanation of the intent before the snippet.
- Use descriptive variable and function names that reflect domain concepts (e.g., `ace_result` instead of `data`).
- Add type hints for function signatures and complex variables.
- Comment non-trivial logic paths, focusing on the "why" rather than restating the code.
- Raise or log errors with actionable context (input parameters, API endpoints, ids) to simplify triage.

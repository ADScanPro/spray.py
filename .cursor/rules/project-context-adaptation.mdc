# Project Context Adaptation

This is a simple single-script project, not a full package. Adapt rules accordingly:

## Structure
- Single script `spray.py` in project root is acceptable (no need for `src/` structure)
- Tests can be added later if needed, but not required for MVP
- Documentation in README.md is sufficient

## Logging
- Use `loguru` for simple, powerful logging (better than standard logging or Rich)
- Loguru provides colored logs, automatic tracebacks, and simple API
- Use `{}` format strings instead of `%s` formatting
- Log at appropriate levels: DEBUG for detailed info, INFO for user-facing, ERROR for failures

## Configuration
- Environment variables are sufficient (no need for `pydantic-settings` for this simple project)
- Use `.env.example` to document required variables
- Support both `.env` file and environment variables

## Dependencies
- Use `pyproject.toml` for dependency management
- Keep dependencies minimal - only what's strictly needed
- Document external tool requirements (kerbrute, netexec) in README

## Code Quality
- Type hints: Required for all functions
- Docstrings: Google-style for public functions
- Error handling: Explicit try/except with proper logging
- Timeouts: Add timeouts to all subprocess calls

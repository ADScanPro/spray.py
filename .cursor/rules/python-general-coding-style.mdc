- Prefer standalone functions for stateless helpers; introduce classes only when encapsulating state or behaviour.
- Enforce code style consistency using `uv run ruff check --fix`.
- Enable Ruff's `--unsafe-fixes` only after reviewing the diff.
- Indent using 4 spaces.
- Keep lines ≤ 120 characters unless readability would suffer.
- Use `#` for single-line comments and triple double quotes (`"""`) for docstrings; reserve block comments for multi-line explanations.
- When adding comments, explain intent or edge cases rather than paraphrasing the code.
